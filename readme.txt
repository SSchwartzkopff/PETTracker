Programs written for the master thesis: "Machine Learning for Event Classification in Positron Emission Tomography for Range Verification of Proton Therapy"

The task of these programs is to identify positron-electron annihilation events with the help of a neural network (PETTracker.ipynb).

The network is taught and tested on simulation data generated by MEGAlib simulations.
The simulation data will be prepared with the help of DataPreparation.ipynb.

Included are:
	DataPreparation.ipynb - (Jupyter Notebook file) turns simulation files ".sim" from MEGAlib into ".csv" files usable by the neural network
	PETTracker.ipynb      - (Jupyter Notebook file) all programs neural network related, contains the model, can load and save model, can create data sets and test them, also contains optuna training for hyperparameters

	Example Data              - example of the prepared data
	Example Simulation        - example of a simulation file created by MEGAlib
	Notebooks as Python Files - both the PETTracker and DataPreperation notebooks can be found here as ".py" files
	Output                    - the network will save its output in this folder, this was already done for the file in the "Example Data" folder
	Saved Network             - the trained network and it's training parameters are saved in this folder
	TrainNorm                 - the normalization values used for the training data are saved in this folder (they have to be applied to any new data)
	PETTracker-study.db       - the database for the optuna hyperparameter tuning which includes all parameters that were tested and their performance
	SimToDataframe.py         - all the functions used for the data preparation in "DataPreparation.ipynb"

The ".ipynb" are jupyter notebooks that include the main code to run the data preparation as well as the network.
Simulation data should first be prepared with "DataPreparation.ipynb". The resulting ".csv" files can be used with the neural network in "PETTracker.ipynb".
